## Developer Content as a Service

Solves the problem of every technical leader trying to gain traction and community around their technolgy.

If you're a tech-startup and regularly pushing code and updates to your repo but not getting enough traffic and signups, you're not alone. Every startup faces a wide & complex issues with their content strategy because non-technical marketing teams exhaust resources towards blog posts, white-papers, and social media noise. None is this really works for startup with technology as their core products.

SEO is a wide, complex, and at times frustating aspects of internet marketing, buts it's one that you can't afford of ignore. Because your audience is relatively smaller than a consumer startup with either product or a service.
