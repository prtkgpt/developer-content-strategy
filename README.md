## Developer Content as a Service

A problem that almost every technical leader trying to gain traction and community around their technology is having a robust content strategy. 
If you’re a tech-startup and regularly pushing code and updates to your repo but not getting enough traffic and signups, you’re not alone. 

Every startup faces broad & complex issues with their content strategy because non-technical marketing teams exhaust resources towards traditional marketing. Most of this effort as an experiment turns into a learn to write about on medium. It doesn't really works for startups with technology as their core products.

SEO is a wide, complex, and at times frustrating aspects of internet marketing, buts its one that you can’t afford of ignore. Because your audience is relatively smaller than a consumer startup with either product or a service.
